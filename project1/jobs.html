        <p>
          Fun Fact: The term "Data Scientist" was coined in 2008 and has since
          become one of the most in-demand roles in tech!
          <br><br>
          Fun Fact: Data analytics is helping conservationists track koala
          populations through satellite imaging and machine learning models.
          Tech isn't just for business — it's saving lives!
          <br><br>
          Fun Fact: Excel is still used in over 80% of businesses for data
          handling, even in high-tech industries. It's not old-school — it's
          essential.
          <br><br>
          Fun Fact: In Australia, demand for data-related roles has outpaced
          supply by over 3:1. If you’ve got the skills, you’ve already got a
          head start.
          <br><br>
          Fun Fact: A hacker attack happens every 39 seconds on average. That’s
          over 2,200 attacks per day — and why cybersecurity specialists are
          more crucial than ever.
          <br><br>
          Fun Fact: The term "hacker" originally referred to someone who enjoyed
          understanding and tinkering with systems, not breaking them. Now,
          ethical hackers use those same skills to protect companies.
          <br><br>
          Fun Fact: Over 95% of cybersecurity breaches are caused by human error
          — that’s why cybersecurity isn’t just about tech, but also about
          training and awareness.
          <br><br>
          Fun Fact: The Australian Cyber Security Centre receives one cybercrime
          report every 6 minutes. That’s 240 per day. And growing.
